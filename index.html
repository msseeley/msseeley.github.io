		<h6 class="entry-text"> <p> Sweta, Shir, Hub and I decided our little voyage into the unknown would take place in the form of roller disco, which turned out to be Prince themed (circa Purple Rain).</p> 
<p>Back when I had short hair, I actually dressed up as Prince for Halloween, just wish I'd kept the coat and ascot. We can look surprisingly alike, which I'd like to attribute to Prince's effeminate looks, but might have something to do with my jaw line. But the costuming was enjoyable, if a bit last minute. 80s Prince, however, did not dress for warm weatherâ€“I was wearing leather pants and a velvet blazer. Perhaps I went a little overboard because most people were not as detail oriented as I was and they were probably a lot more comfortable. Anyway, I was so preoccupied with the costume part that it wasn't until I was actually lacing up my skates that I realized I didn't know how to skate, which is when I really started to get nervous.</p>
<p>The roller disco itself was packed, which actually afforded a kind of anonymity. Many of the attendees were just as inexperienced as I was. Somehow I thought that there would be less people with a greater fan attachment. But it was more like a concert in the park. There were, of course, a subset of really skilled skaters and few who were unabashedly getting into the groove of it all, but I would say they were in the minority. The event itself didn't seem particularly exclusive, I'd say that it attracted more of a trendy crowd overall--such is the eternal appeal of Prince and the nostalgia of roller skating. At the same time, going alone rather than in a group would have made a difference as people didn't really interact outside of their respective groups, unless someone fell down, in which case people were keen to help out.</p> 
<p>The admission was $18, which covered the skate rental, but not the drinks that were served. It seemed relatively reasonable for New York activities, though potentially was a barrier to entry.</p></h6>

		<h5 class="entry-text"> Thoughts/Reactions</h5>
		<h6 class="entry-text"> <p>This weeks readings, Loving Music and Shooter Boys and At-Risk Girls, respectively covered the birth of music fandom and the alarmism attached to certain subversive subcultures. The pieces were different takes on the class politics surrounding taste and expression and deviant behavior.</p> 
		<p>Molly Crabapples piece resonated more for me probably because of the shared experience of being subject to rather totalitarian public schooling governance and the hypersensitivity that society seems to have concerning unhappy girls. I understood the social pressure to smile, to be likable, and embrace the pseudo citizenship of being a minor and the price of not doing so. This pressure seems to co-exist with antithetical stereotypes of teenage angst.</p>
		<p>Loving Music mentions the stigma of fandom as a pathological disorder for music fans and then a latter normalization of fan behavior. Comparing the early, "deviant" fans I wonder if there's a different draw to fandom. Perhaps this would be the allure of subcultural niche. Or,  why are some people drawn to subcultures versus normative/normalized cultures? Is there a difference in the pull between the level of establishment of the subculture? And in the "digital age" does this change now that the internet opens up (potentially normalizing effect)? </p></h6>
