		<p>This week’s readings covered the branding and authenticity with two pieces—one on wrestling fandom and the other on fashion logo branding. The wrestling piece covered the ways in which fans viewed the wrestling world like WWE and later forming backyard wrestling using a video camera. The piece on logo branding described the development of branding particularly with logo branding. Though each subject wrestling and logos are different in media the pieces are both concern themselves with fan interpretation of meaning.</p>
		<p>At the same there is still a lot of magic within the interpretation process. The wrestling fandom community was divided among Smarts and Marks, however, these broad categories no doubt belied greater complexity within various groups of smarts and marks as well as potentially a smart-mark spectrum of positions. Logos branding seemed perhaps the most variable, especially when it came to appeals. Hello Kitty for example thrived on its simplicity and its lack of specific meaning and therefore the variety of meaning it could take on from fans, a kind of customizable meaning. However, by contrast, brands like Ralph Lauren Polo carried more specific meanings. Such mass interpretation of meaning while explained by both articles still seemed to have an element of magic associated with it. How can you tell what branding will work and won’t work? Which fan meanings will catch on? It seems like a difficult thing to predict or control, so I’m not sure if the understanding of why  a brand catches on  can get at the how future brands might work.</p>

		<h5 class="entry-text">
		<p>Chapter One: Tank</p>
		<p>“What is it?” said Wash. “Modern art, maybe? Are you sure Banks didn’t get the runaround on you?” He had just bent down to examine the latest addition to Firefly’s haul: a small glass tank that appeared to be suspending a bunch of tech in blue fluid.</p>
		<p>“Banks died trying to protect this,” said Zoe.</p>
		<p>“Yeah,” said Mal, “And a shifty, slimy bastard like Banks woulda been smart enough to make money off a grift. You know before dying and all.” Mal was still covered in what looked a few liters of Banks’ blood and seemed to be in mood. He regarded the tank from a distance as though it might explode right there in the cargo bay. </p>
		<p>“You didn’t kill him, did you?” said Simon eyeing Mal’s clothes.
		“Not the way I operate,” said Mal.</p>
		<p>“That would be so much more convincing if you weren’t covered in blood,” said Simon.</p>
 		<p>“Banks wasn’t a charming fellow, but he was smart enough not to get on the wrong side of a deal,” said Mal swatting away Simon’s complaints.</p>
		<p>“He gave us the parts up front. It was a good deal on our side,” said Zoe, “I think it was the two in the bar who got to Banks.”</p>
		<p>“You’re right, they did look a little too clean for Banks’ associates,” said Mal.</p>
		<p>“Speaking of which,” said Wash giving Mal a once over.</p>
		<p>“Are you telling me I need to take a shower?” said Mal. </p>
		<p>“No! Of course not!” said Wash, “One’s not nearly enough.”  Mal replied with a menacing look causing Wash to jump up and declare some sort of need to go off to the cockpit. </p>
		<p>“I know we’re generally not in the business of asking questions, but that thing doesn’t sit right with me. We need to keep an eye on it,” said Mal nodding to Zoe.</p>
		<p>“If you’re so alarmed by it, why don’t we just throw it off the ship?” said Simon.</p>
		<p>“Just because it don’t sit right, doesn’t mean it ain’t valuable and I gotta crew who needs to eat and a ship that needs maintenance. Maybe we can get a little good out of this situation, and by that I mean a little cold hard cash. Now what I need for you is to keep your nose out of this and, preferably, your sister’s too. God knows what she’d do with this thing.”</p>
		<p>“I’ll keep an eye on things, sir,” said Zoe, “So you can go and take a shower.” Mal looked slightly surprised and insulted but couldn’t seem to argue with either statements. Instead he walked off to his quarters, presumably to take a shower.</p>
		<p>***</p>
		<p>The next morning, the crew gathered for breakfast. River had become momentarily fascinated with the molecular structure of food and had made a number of experimental dishes.</p>
		<p>“Should we really be eating any of this?” said Jane eyeing a gelatinous substance in his bowl. “I mean how do we know she didn’t go bonkers and put jet fuel in this?”</p>
		<p>“Oh don’t be such a spoil sport, Jane!” said Kaylee. “It’s not everyday that you get people cooking for you. Certainly doesn’t happen much for me. This looks lovely, River, thank you!”</p>
		<p>“Besides, I don’t seem to recall you caring much what you put in that gob of yours,” said Mal.</p>
		<p>Nevertheless the crew dished up their food with hesitation. It was Kaylee who was brave enough to take the first bite.</p>
		<p>“This is, this is…amazing. River you’re a genius!” said Kaylee.
		<p>“Of course.” said River nonchalantly flitting around the mess hall kitchen. </p>
		<p>The anticipation bated, the crew dug in and there was silence for a few minutes as everyone ate.</p>
		<p>“So,” said Jane, pushing back his bowl, “What’re we gonna do with Banks’s spooky thingamajig?”</p>
		<p>“We do have a few contacts, associates of Banks’s, who could help us out,” said Zoe.</p>
		<p>“I’m more worried about the people who killed Banks,” said Mal. “We get to them and we figure out what this entire thing is about.”
		<p>“Of course, what could possibly go wrong hunting down known killers?” said Simon his voice rising. </p>
		<p>“Something tells me that Banks’s associates aren’t too shiny either,” said Wash studying Zoe’s expression.</p>
		<p>“Right, I must be kidding myself. Most of the people in this room are known killers,” said Simon throwing up his hands. The mess hall went quiet.</p>
		<p>“You’re going to to want to watch what you say to known killers,” said Mal. Simon shrunk into his seat a little. “The plan as I see it, is to go retrace Banks’s steps, which means—“</p>
		<p>“We’ve got to go back,” said Zoe. </p>
		<p>“Exactly,” said Mal. “Wash, you got that?” “Yeah I’m on it,” said Wash getting pushing in his chair. </p>
		<p>“Banks had a lot of friends…and a lot of enemies. We’ll be better to be discreet,” said Zoe.</p>
		<p>“Taking the fun out of it,” grunted Jane.</p>
		<p>“That’ll be the least of our problems,” said Mal. “I just hope whoever we’re looking for was dumb enough to leave a trail.”
		<p>“Usually are,” said Jane through a mouthful of food.</p>
		<p>“That won’t be a problem,” said River, who had begun finger painting with the remaining food on her plate. “They’ll find us.” The room went quiet.</p>
		<p>Almost on cue, the ship’s alarm went off.</p>
		<p>“Captain!” Wash’s voice rang out over the loud speaker. “We’ve got company!”</p>
		<p>Mal dashed up through the ship into the cockpit. Wash was sitting white knuckled staring out through the window. An Alliance ship hovered out a few meters starboard.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Fandom Identities and Communities- The Future of Fandom (Jenkins)</li>
				<li>Buying In: The Straw Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</li>
			</ul>
			
		<h4 class="entry-text"> Thoughts/Reactions</h4>
		<h5 class="entry-text">
		<p>This week's readings covered the relationship between fandom and consumerism. Fandoms play a significant role in promoting goods and services, but also are responsible for creating the goods and services that many companies (big and small) have marketed.</p>
		<p>Rob Walker's piece in Buying In "The Straw Man in the Grey Flannel Suit" covered fan cultures and their production of products and culture. Focusing on the example of skateboarding and skater culture, Walker discusses how skating subculture ( a kind of fandom) created products, practices, ethos, and group that would later become a larger phenomenon in popular culture, but, more importantly, launched or were affiliated with a myriad of different brands and advertising strategies. Walker also notes how these relationships were not simply a matter of outside corporate interests capitalizing on youth subculture, but that people within the culture create and market goods and services as well. In focusing on skater culture, Walker also focuses on subculture pre-internet age.</p> 
		<p>Jenkins's work in "The Future of Fandom" can be seen as extending into the digital age and considering how mass communication and community oriented technology, more commonly known as social media, might be changing the ways in which fandom cultures organize. One question that Jenkins brings up is the whether subculture has a foil to define itself against, or whether the mass American culture has dissolved into various overlapping niche fandoms. Jenkins posits that this can either boost or dissolve the value of fan groups and fan organization. In relation to consumerism, Jenkins notes the significant roles that fan culture has in shaping advertisement and content creation. He cites the growing ability of individuals to produce and distribute content as well as participate in fan communities. Such abilities in many ways has shifted the power away from advertisers in promoting and creating content to be received by consumers without comment or dialogue.</p> 
		<p>When thinking of advertising there's a part of me that inherently cringes. My generation has been so bombarded with blatant advertising that at this point many of us are pretty annoyed if not resentful toward it. Television commercials come to mind and the rise of Netflix and now commercial-less Hulu seem to show this. I personally prefer to price shop and compare products before I go out and buy things, but that might just be me.  If the rise of hipster culture has shown anything, it's that there's an appeal to 'niche' products that at least feel individualized/customized. This doesn't mean that there isn't brand loyalty, but things like ads for soda seem whole unappealing to me. Of course I'm probably quite shaped by my politics, social class, etc. So I'm probably not the market for this.</p>
		<p>Another trend I've seen in the media is a relative increase in diversity, something that has in part been attributed to census projections and the push to market to people of color, which then affects things like sponsored culture like television, magazines, etc. The thing is that these groups have historically be excluded from a significant portion of fandoms and in some ways could only partially participate or identify within fan groups. For example, I like Dr. Who, but it is, primarily, concerned with an eccentric, old, white male and his mostly white female companions. So I like it, but my ability to identify with it is in many ways limited. I could say the same about many of the fandom demographics surround Dr. Who, which are more diverse, but certainly the cultural experiences emphasized are, for lack of a better term, white middle-class. One thing I wonder, is if groups that have been historically left out of fan representations form their attachments in different ways...perhaps they are more willing to accept/participate in fandoms that they only partially identify with? Perhaps they are less likely to form fan groups in the same ways? But when we market to historically disenfranchised groups i.e. women, people of color, lower socio economic class, does this also change the behavioral/cultural appeals? And if so, how?</p>

		<p>This week Daria, Melissa, and I went to Sukkot on Sunday at the Kabbalah Center. I'm not particularly well informed about Kabbalah traditions so as much as I participated in this group cohesion activity, I can't say that I personally had a connection to the ritual performance. As far as I can tell, Kabbalah is centered around a kind of spiritual transformation and subsequent actualization (transcendence in conformity?). When I looked up the website, it sounded very much like a spiritual life philosophy that would attempt to explain the world and guide followers on a path. It sounded a lot like New Age philosophy and Eastern religions such as Daoism or Buddhism as opposed to Christian religions which seem to incorporate specific story elements into the faith (i.e. recognition of Jesus Christ). At the same time, Kabbalah is rooted in Judaism and uses its religious texts as a basis or means of explaining its philosophy. This part, I had to look up because the Kabbalah Center didn't seem to make this explicit in their "about us" page.</p>

		<p>I was actually surprised to see the kind of diversity, people of different ethnicities, at the dinner. From what I'd heard from Daria, Kabbalah had been traditionally a kind of "old, white, male" tradition in Judaism. I expected that I wouldn't blend in, but there seemed to be enough people that it didn't matter. It is tradition for the men to wear white to Sukkot but not everyone adhered to this tradition and it seemed fine.</p>

		<p>Because Sukkoth is a kind of celebration of the new year, the dinner started out with discussions about what we'd done in the year and what we hoped to achieve in future. So reflection and resolutions (communication and bonding). The next part was prayer which included song and dance (a kind of emotive play?). I didn't know any of the words, but I've gotten used to this at my boyfriend's passover dinners, so a lot of it was humming along. After the dance/song/prayer we washed our hands and Challah (braided bread, which is delicious and also makes great French Toast the next day) was passed out. The Challah was also served with salt. Not exactly sure why this was, but I'm sure there's symbolism to this. After the bread we were seated for dinner, which seemed generally in line with Israeli and Kosher foods. Daria pointed out that the fish was often followed by a shot of spirits, which apparently has a kind of nurturing affect on the soul.</p> 

		<p>One thing I noticed about all of Sukkot is how fun most of the activities were meant to be. Dancing, singing, eating, drinking. It was certainly more of a celebration and all of activities were very oriented around bonding in prayer or respect. Generally my own experience with religious rituals have been less fun, personally I'm thinking about Catholic Mass, which is spoken in Latin and utterly boring and painful if you actually decide to do all the kneeling. But then again, it is New Years.</p>

			Entry 3: Where do fans come from?

		<h4 class="entry-text"> Thoughts/Reactions</h4>
		<h5 class="entry-text">
			<p>This weeks readings on Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers and Sir Cliff Richard covered two kinds of fan groups: one that is less socially stigmatized (TPATH) and what seems to be a more stigmatized fan group (Cliff Richard). Both TPATH and Richards had a "wholesome" appeal to their music, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s when rock was considered more universally rebellious than perhaps it is now. Both Richard and TPATH fans are attracted to "good Christian morals" of family and religion. However the groups depart in terms of para-social relationships. Richard fans are strongly para-social in that their fan worship is very focused on Cliff Richard as an idol, whereas TPATH fans often focus on the ethos of TPATH--both Tom Petty and The Heartbreaks--and are often focused on the communal values that TPATH represents.  Another significant difference between TPATH and Richard fans is age group appeal. TPATH fans have a significant age range of fans, which in some ways might be attributed to the widespread appeal of TPATH as a group--having a balance of commercial, critical, and peer success within the music industry. Richard fans, tended to be older and have come of age during the years in which Richard and his genre of music came onto the scene.</p>
			<p>As a TPATH listener (though perhaps not fan per the standards of the article), I was actually surprised by the analysis of "good Christian values" that seemed to unite TPATH fans. I always took the religious references in the lyrics to be somewhat ironic, or simply descriptive of stereotypical Americana, but without a particular reverence for it. TPATH appealed to me because they didn't seem like they were trying to prove something with a particular bravado or performance, but a kind of chill yet keen observance of American culture and perhaps the struggle that is banality its evils. I really loved the Alice and Wonderland themed "Don't Come Around Here No More," which seemed to represent a more off-putting sense of American culture, without having to rage against the machine. I looked Cliff Richard up on youtube and I was strongly reminded of Donald Trump. I mean the guy looks a lot like an Oompa Loompa. It was entertaining, but difficult to relate to his appeal.</p>
			<p>I think the readings certainly clarified some aspects about cultural meaning, particularly considering what does it mean when someone likes the same things as you do. Part of it seems like there is meaning, but at the same time, it doesn't mean that this other person isn't a douche. So I guess the point, is that fan cultures are not necessarily a group of people who "get along" and getting along has a lot to do with the kind of attachments that you and the other person have to the fan object. One question I was left with is whether there are certain kinds of fans, as in fans who predominantly form para-social attachments versus a more tribal social attachments? Or are people generally a mix of each? Another question I have concerns things like race, class, etc. If you're in a more stratified social community where your race, class, gender, etc are more restricted/defined does this change your fan behavior--your ability to identify, the para or tribal social connections? I imagine these are more difficult questions to ask, perhaps no real answer.</p>

		<h5 class="entry-text"> <p> Sweta, Shir, Hub and I decided our little voyage into the unknown would take place in the form of roller disco, which turned out to be Prince themed (circa Purple Rain).</p> 
<p>Back when I had short hair, I actually dressed up as Prince for Halloween, just wish I'd kept the coat and ascot. We can look surprisingly alike, which I'd like to attribute to Prince's effeminate looks, but might have something to do with my jaw line. But the costuming was enjoyable, if a bit last minute. 80s Prince, however, did not dress for warm weather–I was wearing leather pants and a velvet blazer. Perhaps I went a little overboard because most people were not as detail oriented as I was and they were probably a lot more comfortable. Anyway, I was so preoccupied with the costume part that it wasn't until I was actually lacing up my skates that I realized I didn't know how to skate, which is when I really started to get nervous.</p>
<p>The roller disco itself was packed, which actually afforded a kind of anonymity. Many of the attendees were just as inexperienced as I was. Somehow I thought that there would be less people with a greater fan attachment. But it was more like a concert in the park. There were, of course, a subset of really skilled skaters and few who were unabashedly getting into the groove of it all, but I would say they were in the minority. The event itself didn't seem particularly exclusive, I'd say that it attracted more of a trendy crowd overall--such is the eternal appeal of Prince and the nostalgia of roller skating. At the same time, going alone rather than in a group would have made a difference as people didn't really interact outside of their respective groups, unless someone fell down, in which case people were keen to help out.</p> 
<p>The admission was $18, which covered the skate rental, but not the drinks that were served. It seemed relatively reasonable for New York activities, though potentially was a barrier to entry.</p></h5>

		<h6 class="entry-text"> <p>This weeks readings, Loving Music and Shooter Boys and At-Risk Girls, respectively covered the birth of music fandom and the alarmism attached to certain subversive subcultures. The pieces were different takes on the class politics surrounding taste and expression and deviant behavior.</p> 
		<p>Molly Crabapples piece resonated more for me probably because of the shared experience of being subject to rather totalitarian public schooling governance and the hypersensitivity that society seems to have concerning unhappy girls. I understood the social pressure to smile, to be likable, and embrace the pseudo citizenship of being a minor and the price of not doing so. This pressure seems to co-exist with antithetical stereotypes of teenage angst.</p>
		<p>Loving Music mentions the stigma of fandom as a pathological disorder for music fans and then a latter normalization of fan behavior. Comparing the early, "deviant" fans I wonder if there's a different draw to fandom. Perhaps this would be the allure of subcultural niche. Or,  why are some people drawn to subcultures versus normative/normalized cultures? Is there a difference in the pull between the level of establishment of the subculture? And in the "digital age" does this change now that the internet opens up (potentially normalizing effect)? </p></h6>
