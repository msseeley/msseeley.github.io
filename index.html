			Entry 3: Where do fans come from?
		</h2>
		<h3 class="entry-date">September 23, 2015</h3>
		<h4 class="entry-readings"> Readings
			<ul>
				<li>Tom Petty: Temperance and religiosity in a non-marginal, non-stigmatized brand community</li>
				<li>Imprinting, Incubation and Intensification: Factors Contributing to Fan Club Formation and Continuance</li>

		<h5 class="entry-text">
			<p>This weeks readings on Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers and Sir Cliff Richard covered two kinds of fan groups: one that is less socially stigmatized (TPATH) and what seems to be a more stigmatized fan group (Cliff Richard). Both TPATH and Richards had a "wholesome" appeal to their music, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s when rock was considered more universally rebellious than perhaps it is now. Both Richard and TPATH fans are attracted to "good Christian morals" of family and religion. However the groups depart in terms of para-social relationships. Richard fans are strongly para-social in that their fan worship is very focused on Cliff Richard as an idol, whereas TPATH fans often focus on the ethos of TPATH--both Tom Petty and The Heartbreaks--and are often focused on the communal values that TPATH represents.  Another significant difference between TPATH and Richard fans is age group appeal. TPATH fans have a significant age range of fans, which in some ways might be attributed to the widespread appeal of TPATH as a group--having a balance of commercial, critical, and peer success within the music industry. Richard fans, tended to be older and have come of age during the years in which Richard and his genre of music came onto the scene.</p>
			<p>As a TPATH listener (though perhaps not fan per the standards of the article), I was actually surprised by the analysis of "good Christian values" that seemed to unite TPATH fans. I always took the religious references in the lyrics to be somewhat ironic, or simply descriptive of stereotypical Americana, but without a particular reverence for it. TPATH appealed to me because they didn't seem like they were trying to prove something with a particular bravado or performance, but a kind of chill yet keen observance of American culture and perhaps the struggle that is banality its evils. I really loved the Alice and Wonderland themed "Don't Come Around Here No More," which seemed to represent a more off-putting sense of American culture, without having to rage against the machine. I looked Cliff Richard up on youtube and I was strongly reminded of Donald Trump. I mean the guy looks a lot like an Oompa Loompa. It was entertaining, but difficult to relate to his appeal.</p>
			<p>I think the readings certainly clarified some aspects about cultural meaning, particularly considering what does it mean when someone likes the same things as you do. Part of it seems like there is meaning, but at the same time, it doesn't mean that this other person isn't a douche. So I guess the point, is that fan cultures are not necessarily a group of people who "get along" and getting along has a lot to do with the kind of attachments that you and the other person have to the fan object. One question I was left with is whether there are certain kinds of fans, as in fans who predominantly form para-social attachments versus a more tribal social attachments? Or are people generally a mix of each? Another question I have concerns things like race, class, etc. If you're in a more stratified social community where your race, class, gender, etc are more restricted/defined does this change your fan behavior--your ability to identify, the para or tribal social connections? I imagine these are more difficult questions to ask, perhaps no real answer.</p>

		<h5 class="entry-text"> <p> Sweta, Shir, Hub and I decided our little voyage into the unknown would take place in the form of roller disco, which turned out to be Prince themed (circa Purple Rain).</p> 
<p>Back when I had short hair, I actually dressed up as Prince for Halloween, just wish I'd kept the coat and ascot. We can look surprisingly alike, which I'd like to attribute to Prince's effeminate looks, but might have something to do with my jaw line. But the costuming was enjoyable, if a bit last minute. 80s Prince, however, did not dress for warm weatherâ€“I was wearing leather pants and a velvet blazer. Perhaps I went a little overboard because most people were not as detail oriented as I was and they were probably a lot more comfortable. Anyway, I was so preoccupied with the costume part that it wasn't until I was actually lacing up my skates that I realized I didn't know how to skate, which is when I really started to get nervous.</p>
<p>The roller disco itself was packed, which actually afforded a kind of anonymity. Many of the attendees were just as inexperienced as I was. Somehow I thought that there would be less people with a greater fan attachment. But it was more like a concert in the park. There were, of course, a subset of really skilled skaters and few who were unabashedly getting into the groove of it all, but I would say they were in the minority. The event itself didn't seem particularly exclusive, I'd say that it attracted more of a trendy crowd overall--such is the eternal appeal of Prince and the nostalgia of roller skating. At the same time, going alone rather than in a group would have made a difference as people didn't really interact outside of their respective groups, unless someone fell down, in which case people were keen to help out.</p> 
<p>The admission was $18, which covered the skate rental, but not the drinks that were served. It seemed relatively reasonable for New York activities, though potentially was a barrier to entry.</p></h5>

		<h5 class="entry-text"> Thoughts/Reactions</h5>
		<h6 class="entry-text"> <p>This weeks readings, Loving Music and Shooter Boys and At-Risk Girls, respectively covered the birth of music fandom and the alarmism attached to certain subversive subcultures. The pieces were different takes on the class politics surrounding taste and expression and deviant behavior.</p> 
		<p>Molly Crabapples piece resonated more for me probably because of the shared experience of being subject to rather totalitarian public schooling governance and the hypersensitivity that society seems to have concerning unhappy girls. I understood the social pressure to smile, to be likable, and embrace the pseudo citizenship of being a minor and the price of not doing so. This pressure seems to co-exist with antithetical stereotypes of teenage angst.</p>
		<p>Loving Music mentions the stigma of fandom as a pathological disorder for music fans and then a latter normalization of fan behavior. Comparing the early, "deviant" fans I wonder if there's a different draw to fandom. Perhaps this would be the allure of subcultural niche. Or,  why are some people drawn to subcultures versus normative/normalized cultures? Is there a difference in the pull between the level of establishment of the subculture? And in the "digital age" does this change now that the internet opens up (potentially normalizing effect)? </p></h6>
